# CS-255
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass, a company that trains drivers for their road test. The system I designed allowed a customer to choose a training package, make training reservations, take online classes and tests, and view feedback from training.
What did you do particularly well?
My use case diagram captured all the necessary functions of the system and had all the actors needed.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the sequence diagram. I didn't know that the diagram was only supposed to have one actor. I would choose the customer as the actor and replace the other actors with what they interact with.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I made sure to include the user's needs as functions in my diagrams. The user's needs are important to include in the design because the functions of the system benefit the user.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I would use the diagrams that I learned in this course in designing software. It lays out everything needed and makes things easy to follow and understand.
